<p>Project Context:
At the last board meeting of Omega Group Plc., the headquarters of a large multinational company, the issue was raised that women were being discriminated in the company, in the sense that the salaries were not the same for male and female executives. A quick analysis of a sample of 50 employees (of which 24 men and 26 women) revealed that the average salary for men was about 8,700 higher than for women. This seemed like a considerable difference, so it was decided that a further analysis of the company salaries was warranted.</p>
<p>For the project, the objective is to find out whether there is indeed a significant difference between the salaries of men and women, and whether the difference is due to discrimination or whether it is based on another, possibly valid, determining factor.</p>

<h3>Hypothesis Testing</h3>
<p>To perform a hypothesis testing, we assume the null hypothesis (H<sub>0</sub>) that there is no difference in <em>mean salary</em> between men and women (difference is zero), and the alternative Hypothesis (H<sub>a</sub>) that there is a difference in <em>mean salary</em> between men and women (difference is non-zero).</p>

In other words, given what we observed, the null hypothesis is false and it will be impossible to observed such results if the null hypothesis is true. Hence, we can reject the null world and conclude that **there is a significant difference between the salaries of male and female executives*.</p>

<h2>Relationship (Experience - Gender)</h2>
<p>At the board meeting, someone raised the issue that there was indeed a substantial difference between male and female salaries, but that this was attributable to other reasons such as differences in experience. A questionnaire send out to the 50 executives in the sample reveals that the average experience of the men is approximately 21 years, whereas the women only have about 7 years experience on average (see table below).</p>
