<p>My 10 month internship at TikTok really inspires my mind and build up my own perception of internet products.</p>
<p>I tend to divide products into two sub-categories, feature products and strategy products. Apparently, feature product is the blood and bones of an application. It’s filled with inspirational contents and practical functions that users can use, feel and see with rare confusion. And feature product manager cares most about user journey and experience, eager to build up a platform that the majority of users can easily perceive and get used to. While strategy product is more like the nervous system, which connects different features and facilitate consistent user journey. Strategy product helps to stimulate user activeness, achieve user growth, and allocate benefits. It’s very result and data driven, and silently supports the circulation of product ecosystem.</p>
<p>At TikTok, I was luckily involved in the establishment of Growth Platform, which is a crucial part of our Business Account ecosystem and user growth. I built up the model to identify potential commercial users and made up suitable message templates. Through multiple A/B test and iteration of the model and contents, our team achieved a lift from 5% click rate to 90% click rate. I also drafted metric framework to engineer data profiling and build up dashboards for performance measuring.</p>
<p>I’m grateful for the opportunity at TikTok, which opened my gate to technology and light up my passion for data-driven strategy making. Also, I’m very lucky to have fantastic mentoring and guidance from my teammates and leaders, Siyu and Fan, who also gave me great trust on owning and pushing forward my own projects. I excitedly look forward to my next chapter unfolding at the crossroad of tech and strategy.</p>
