Intentionally cultivating my interdisciplinary application abilities, I decided to pursue my Masters in Analytics and Management degree at London Business School, adding more data and strategy knowledge reserve on my applied Statistics undergraduate study. I believe my diverse academic background and cross-industry professional experience equip me with better skills for the fast-changing and challenging society.

I am expected to get my Masters in Analytics and Management at London Business School in 2022. My core courses include Data Science for Business, Operation Management, Machine Learning for Big Data, Storytelling and etc. LBS was founded in 1964 and awards post-graduate degrees. LBS is consistently ranked amongst the world's best business schools.

I gained my Bachelor in Science degree on Applied Statistics at Renmin University of China in 2021. My core corses include Probability Theory, Statistics, Microeconomics, Stochastic Progress, Risk Management and etc. RUC is considered the most prestigious University for humanities and social sciences in China.
