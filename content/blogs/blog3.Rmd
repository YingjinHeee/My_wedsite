title: 25 funny things about me
---

1. I love travelling and adventures. I travelled alone to Switzerland, France, and Italy last year. The most memorable moment was when I paraglided down a snowy mountain, overlooking the entire picturesque view of Jungfrau Mountain.
2. I enjoy cultural exchanges. My roommate was an Argentinian girl when I was in Germany, and we liked to share our views on food, customs and cultural stereotypes. Weeks ago, she sent me a thank- you email about how our talks inspired her and broke her biased opinions about China. She now wants to pursue her master’s degree in Beijing!
3. Tennis is my favorite sport. I have played since freshman year, and I still spend three hours on it every week no matter how busy I am.
4. I have a sister and we are each other’s best motivation. She is studying medicine at Harvard. We arrange phone calls every week to share our progress and advice for each other personally and professionally.
5. I joined Renmin Gender Research Club and started volunteering at the Beijing LGBTQ center in my freshman year. I once organized a movie sharing meeting on a documentary named Small Talk, which talked about, in the daughter’s perspective, how she spent 25 years to accept her mother’s sexuality and fix their broken relationship until her mother’s death. The long-lasting silence after the movie in the classroom was unforgettable.
6. I am nerdy in some ways. I was once told by my sister that Coke is healthier because it has less sugar than Pepsi. I have never drunk Pepsi again in the time since.
7. Interstellar is my favorite movie. I watched it more than eight times in the theater. Every time I watch it, I am still stunned and moved by human beings’ courage to explore the unknown in the universe and the family affection and friendship displayed between movie heroes.
8. I enjoy building connections with people I have met. I met a Chinese couple when I was hiking the snow mountain in Luzern, Switzerland. We shared jokes and reached at the peak together. They are back in Hong Kong now, but I still sent them New Year’s cards to catch up. They also provide me with selfless help in application interviews, as one of them is an English teacher.
9. My first pet was a stray cat. I found her in the corner of the alley opposite my house. I couldn't bear her starving and gave her some ham pieces. She chased my footprints for the following four years after that.
10. I believe that practice makes perfect. I once had a tough time passing the Men’s 1000 meter requirement for my P.E. class test. To prepare myself, I woke up at six every morning with the morning birds and
ran 3 km to prepare myself. In the end, I got an A on this P.E. test.
11. I was once removed from the bass section in the college choir because my voice is too low -- yes, too
low for the bass.
12. I am family-focused and I do appreciate my parents. This year, I bought my father a new pair of wireless
earphones -- he was very happy, even though it took him weeks to figure out how to use them.

13. Volunteering to help autistic children in Beijing was a formative experience for me. One child gave me a hand-made paper flower every time I visited. I believe they are angels who have not yet grown wings.
14. I set as my life goal as to alleviate the unbalanced distribution of social resources. In 2018, I went to a remote high school to devise solutions to the scarcity of local educational resources. I am still haunted by a girl who grabbed my arm and anxiously asked me if she had a shot at getting into college. Our proposed solutions had a positive impact on the local schools, but I believe there is still a lot I can do
in the future to help more people get the decent education they deserve.
15. I was very quiet and introverted before college. I tried handing out flyers on the street to exercise my
ability to talk first and handle rejection. I am now more courageous about expressing my opinions.
16. I’m terrified of animals with more than 4 legs. Spiders are my lifetime enemies.
17. I stress process more than results. I once took part in a campus instrumental contest with four other
classmates and I played the traditional flute. Even though we didn’t get any award, I still enjoyed the
whole process of getting to know their personalities and working together toward one goal.
18. I have been learning traditional Chinese calligraphy for more than eight years. It’s a good way to calm
myself and refresh my mind. I also cherish it as a precious cultural asset.
19. I once traveled through the airport in my best friend’s hometown before he went abroad. But the hotels
were fully booked around the airport, so we stayed at the airport hall the whole night, recounting our
childhood stories.
20. One of the most delightful memories for me in Cologne, Germany was when a student officer told me
in German as she handed me my student card, “Your photo looks handsome.”
21. My English name is Simon, Because I learned from my American teacher that, in Christianity, Simon
indicates a person who always listens.
22. I gravitate toward school clubs and social charities that help elevate the voices of minorities. My
proudest day was when we finally organized and launched the first Pride Day on the Renmin campus
to provide psychological counseling and academic help for women and sexual minorities.
23. I am one of the few persons in China who still stick to the lunar calendar to celebrate birthdays. I learned
it from my family and I still regard it as a vital part of my cultural self.
24. Always taking social responsibility is one of the core values of my family. During the grave period of
COVID-19 in China, my family donated 5,000 masks were donated to the local anti-epidemic station
in my hometown. We all admire the people who fight on the frontlines against the pandemic.
25. I once organized a spring trip to a lake park on behalf of the class committee. But I took a wrong turn and we ended up hiking a mountain. After realizing the mistake, my companions asked me to sing a
song to fix it. But this just made everything worse.
